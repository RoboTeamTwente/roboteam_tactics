## How do I add a Behavior3 project?
1. Create a B3 project in the src/trees/projects folder with the Behavior3 Editor. Make sure it contains at least one valid tree. For example: a "KickTest" tree, with only a "Kick" node with name "Kick_A" in it.
2. Add it to the `CMakeLists.txt` there.
3. Run `refresh_b3_projects.sh`. This can take a minute or 2.
4. All currently known trees will be printed afterwards. Make sure your new project & trees are in there.
